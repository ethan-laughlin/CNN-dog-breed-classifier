# CNN Dog Breed Classifier

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed and trained to detect dogs and predict their breed from user supplied images from a web app or mobile app. The application identifies the most probable dog breed from the image. If the image supplied is a human, it will identify the dog breed which most resembles the person. 

This project was completed as part of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program.
